# learnHack_path

##  Scope 

WIth this little corner on github I will try to explain the projects I work on and also the things I study and little by little start to understand about the **Magical Hacking World**.

My scope is not to provide a thorough explanation of what I do in order to make the ones reading understand, mostly because there are plenty of webistes where you could get those info and also because I'm just learning. I won't even think that someone is reading what I write, I am just doing this to better understand what I am studying and for future reference. 


If you happen to read the things I write, consider that the one behind the keyboard is an absolute beginner and if you find any errors on mis-explanations be kind and tell me, I need to know what I am doing wrong.
